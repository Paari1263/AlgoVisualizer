# üé® AlgoVisualizer

An interactive tool for visualizing classic computer science algorithms through elegant animations and intuitive interfaces. Watch algorithms come to life as you learn how they work!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Pathfinding Visualizer**: Watch algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, and DFS find their way through mazes
- **Sorting Visualizer**: See how Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more bring order to chaos
- **Binary Search Tree**: Interact with BST operations through smooth animations
- **Interactive Interface**: Draw walls, place start/end points, and control animation speed
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Understand exactly how each algorithm works
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
